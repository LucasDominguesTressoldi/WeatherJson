*A project made in PHP, focusing on the backend, to make requests to the OpenWeather API*

➡️ As you can see, it's quite simple: Simply *type the **name of the city** in the given field and press **Enter** or click the **Search** button*.  
Then, the information about the desired city will appear on the screen, along with the **complete JSON**.

### ⁉️ Configuring it to run on your machine:

🖥️ If you wish to run this project on your machine, you will need to **generate an *API key*** 🗝️ on the OpenWeather website via this link below:

⬇️ To run PHP you also need a server, to create a temporary local server I recommend XAMPP, download it from the link below:

🎉 It's all done!
